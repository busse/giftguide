My wife thought it was rediculous that I was getting a big laundry hamper with so many sections. Ours is actually a four-section not the three shown here, but I couldn't find the four-bagger listed on Amazon anymore. There are others like it with four sections that may be worth checking out. Having this many sections makes laundry much easier. It's not just about lights and darks in our house, but also dress shirts and other things that get washed but hung to dry. These bags are big and the fact that they can be managed individually come wash time makes laundry much easier to work through. <strong>$49.99</strong>
