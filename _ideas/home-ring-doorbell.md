<p>We've been in our current house since 2012, and started with some Z-wave automation and wired cameras to an on-site DVR. I had heard of the Ring Doorbell, but didn't really think too much of it until a neighbor told me that their app creates a "Neighborhood" group and if there's suspicious activity, you can share it to the group.</p>

<p>It was easy to install the Ring Doorbell in place of our existing doorbell, and we've definitely found it to be a "must have" home automation & security item. If you haven't dipped your toe into home automation, it would be a great standalone gadget to start with! <strong>$99.99</strong>
